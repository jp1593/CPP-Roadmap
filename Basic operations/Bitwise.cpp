    //Explanation of why NOT 3 returns -4 as result:
    // 1.  When you apply the NOT operator to 0000 0011, the result is: 1111 1100
    // 2. Interpreting the Result:
    // The result 1111 1100 is in two's complement format (the standard way of representing negative numbers in binary).
    // To find the decimal value of this binary number, you can convert it back to decimal:
    //     The leftmost bit is the sign bit (1 indicates a negative number).
    //     To convert from two's complement, you invert the bits and add 1:
    //         Invert 1111 1100 â†’ 0000 0011
    //         Add 1 â†’ 0000 0100 (which is 4 in decimal)
    //     Then ass the original binary was negative change the 4 to negative.
