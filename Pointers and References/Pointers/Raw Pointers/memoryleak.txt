Memory leakage

Memory leakage occurs when a program allocates memory in the heap but does not release the memory back to the operating system when 
it is no longer needed. Over time, this leads to exhaustion of available memory, resulting in low system performance or crashes.

In C++, when you use raw pointers, you need to manage the memory allocation and deallocation manually.
