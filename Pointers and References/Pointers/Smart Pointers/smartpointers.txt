Unique = only one ownership if the pointer gets out of scope it destroy automatically. 

Shared = Multiple instances can point to the same object and object is destroyed when the last pointer reference to it is deestructed. (it contains reference counting
to know how many instances of the pointer point to the same object)

Weak = It breaks circular references. The control block associated with the object maintains two counts: one for the number of shared_ptrs 
(ownership count) and another for the number of weak_ptrs (weak count). (it dont increase the reference count)
