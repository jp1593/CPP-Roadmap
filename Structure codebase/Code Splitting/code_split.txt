---Separate compilation----

Each source file can be compiled independently into an object file, then they can be combined to generate the final exec. 

Usefull when only a .cpp file has changes, because you only need to recompile the one that you work on.

Ex:
# Compile each source file into an object file
g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o
g++ -c example.cpp -o example.o

# Link object files together to create the executable
g++ main.o example.o -o my_program
